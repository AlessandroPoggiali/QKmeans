# QKmeans
Qantum version of the k-means clustering algorithm[[1]](#1). Three versions of the algorithm are implemented:

1) q-k-means-1: it makes parallel the distance computation between a pair of dataset record
2) q-k-means-2: it makes parallel the cluster assignment to a given record
3) q-k-means-3: it makes parallel the entire step of cluster assignment to every record
